# Popular Movies

This project shows movies from themoviedb.org.

## Configuration

Before launching the app, you need to configure the api key from [moviedb]("https://www.themoviedb.org/"). If you don't have one, just create an account, go to [settings/api]("https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api") and request a key.

After that you need to open a **gradle.properties** file on your **.gradle** folder (If the file was not there you need to create one). Usually it can be found at:

- **Windows:** C:\Users\your_username\.gradle
- **Linux:** /home/your_username/.gradle
- **Mac:** /Users/your_username/.gradle

Next, add **MdbApiKey="<your_key>"** and save it.

That's it! Now your are ready to test the app.

Enjoy ;)
