# Popular Movies [![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/7d859fe76768914b/status.svg?token=rSulaQGeA3UsciGTapO2cQ)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/7d859fe76768914b)

This project shows movies from themoviedb.org.

## Configuration

Before launching the app, you need to configure the api key from [moviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/). If you don't have one, just create an account, go to [settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and request a key.

After that you need to create a **keys.properties** file on root folder. Next, add **MdbApiKey="<your_key>"** and save it.

That's it! Now your are ready to test the app.

Enjoy ;)
